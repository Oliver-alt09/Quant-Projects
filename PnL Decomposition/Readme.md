This project implements a complete PnL attribution engine for a rolling 30-day ATM straddle using Black–Scholes Greeks.
It decomposes daily returns into:

Theta – time decay
Gamma – convexity exposure to price movements
Vega – sensitivity to implied volatility shocks

- Compute ATM straddle Greeks (Gamma, Vega, Theta)  
- Daily PnL decomposition  
- Visualization of Greek contributions  
- Total PnL vs components
